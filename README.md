## Versioning
---

For the sake of transparency in our release cycle and in adherence to the principles of backward compatibility, this repository is meticulously governed by the Semantic Versioning guidelines.

The versioning system is delineated as MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, with the following delineations:

- **MAJOR version** designates substantial, incompatible global changes.
- **MINOR version** is reserved for significant backward-compatible updates and the introduction of new components.
- **PATCH version** is allocated to minor backward-compatible updates, the inclusion of new component variations, and bug fixes.

This systematic approach to versioning is intended to furnish a structured and predictable framework for the evolution of our design system, prioritising precision and coherence in its progression.
